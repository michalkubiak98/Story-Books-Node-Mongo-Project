# Story Books - Node, Express, Mongo. 

This was a project I made for our web frameworks module in college. The frameworks used in this so far are NodeJS, Express and MongoDB. Angular to be added.
The app uses PassportJSâ€™ Google OAuth2 Strategy for authentication. Some other packages are also used and specified below during the build process examination.

## Description

The original project was followed through from a tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY&ab_channel=TraversyMedia, I then put my own spin on the porject and made it into a to-do list, the project also had an angular front-end implementation. I ended up deleting the project somehow on one of my memory sticks, what remains is a word document I sent with the project to my professor. This docuement is in this repo.

I followed the tutorial closely, and by the next semester I have started my academic work placement, in which I was working on a full stack javascript and vue application where the skills i aquired during this project became very useful.
